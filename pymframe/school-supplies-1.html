She’s gotten some grants to buy books.</p></div>

<div class="row amount"><p><span>AMOUNT SPENT PER SCHOOL YEAR </span>$3,000, at minimum; often more.</p></div>
<div class="row what"><p><span>WHAT DOES SHE SPEND ON? </span>Art supplies galore. When she arrived at Nebinger, Grace had an bare classroom and dipped into her own pocket to fill it. She doesn’t skimp on projects for her students - who recently made luchador masks, for instance, with felt and special glue. The burden of funding those projects falls on Grace. Her students, she says, love the atmosphere she provides. &quot;They’re always really excited about the projects. They don’t see what it’s like in some of the other schools that don’t have the funding, where teachers don’t have time to fundraise. They don’t know what drawing on copy paper looks like.&quot;</p></div>
<div class="row family"><p><span>DO FAMILIES SEND IN SUPPLIES? </span>Some parents help with things like wipes and cleaning supplies.</p></div>
<div class="row creative"><p><span>HOW DOES SHE GET CREATIVE? </span>Grace has had success writing grants for projects - she estimates she’s pulled in at least $20,000 in the past several years - but most of the money she spends comes from her own pocket. &quot;I take full advantage of my Amazon Prime membership,&quot; Grace says. She also searches for deals at art-supply stores. Grace is also thinking big-picture: she started an online petition to support a City Council bill that would create a fund to reimburse teachers for the money they spend out of their own pocket on supplies and other necessities for their students. The legislation died, but Grace remains passionate about the issue.</p></div>
<div class="row job"><p><span>IS IT JUST PART OF THE JOB? </span>&quot;Every time I spend money, it gives me pause,&quot; said Grace. &quot;I think it’s awful that It’s so accepted that teachers have to hustle for their money, to fundraise. &quot; Grace lives with her boyfriend and does not have children; she can dip into her own pocket, she says. A teacher coach also once told her not to fundraise, that it would condition administrators to expect Grace and other teachers to provide their own supplies. But &quot;I want my students to have as many exposures to the art as possible, and if I’m spending my own money doing it, that’s just the burden I bear,&quot; she says.</p></div>
<div class="row tax"><p><span>ON THE POSSIBLE TAX-CREDIT LOSS? </span>&quot;Horrible,&quot; Grace said. &quot;I’m disgusted by it. In other profession, people get perks - cars, insurance paid for by their jobs. I’m a teacher, and I have to pay for my own supplies? It shouldn’t be that a millionaire can write off a jet and we lose this deduction.&quot;</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<div class="row amount"><p><span>AMOUNT SPENT PER SCHOOL YEAR </span>YEAR: Over $100 of her own money so far, but that has been supplemented by help from friends and family, including her mother, a veteran Philadelphia School District teacher.</p></div>
<div class="row what"><p><span>WHAT DOES SHE SPEND ON? </span>Erasers, folders, dry erase board erasers, tape. The majority of her spending has been on decorations for her classroom - posters of people Luebbert thought would be good role models for her students - Bayard Rustin, John Lewis, Fannie Lou Hamer. &quot;To set the stage, you have to have a welcoming classroom, but it doesn’t come cheap,&quot; she said.</p></div>
<div class="row job"><p><span>IS IT JUST PART OF THE JOB? </span>Luebbert feels lucky to have a network of people who are able to support her classroom, and knows that not everyone has that. &quot;I just worry about how much burden goes onto teachers. If they aren’t able to produce that kind of output, I worry about how that reflects on them. If you aren’t going above and beyond, you’re not doing your job, and we’re not compensated for all of it.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="row tax"><p><span>ON THE POSSIBLE TAX-CREDIT LOSS? </span>&quot;That would hurt, massively. I spend way more than $250 already, and I use that credit every year. They should double it, not cut it.&quot;</p></div>
